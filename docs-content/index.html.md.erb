## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for VMware Tanzu has the following requirements:

+ The coordinates of the Instana backend: endpoint and endpoint port
+ Instana agent key

All the configurations required for configuring the Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for VMware Tanzu tile for your VMware Tanzu foundation are available in the **More &gt; Management Portal &gt; Install Agent &gt; Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for VMware Tanzu tile** section in the Instana backend.

If you do not already have an Instana backend, Instana offers a self-service trial that is entirely compatible with the Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for VMware Tanzu tile: see the [Instana Free Trial](https://www.instana.com/trial/) page.

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

<!--
Cloud Foundry operators are responsible for installing and updating agents. With BOSH it is best to use the Instana static agent, as such, rolling out of agent fixes requires Cloud Foundry operator action.
-->
Monitoring .NET Core applications running with the dotnet-buildpack is supported for non self-contained applications; see the [Deploying DotNet Core Apps with the DotNet Core Buildpack](./using.html#deploying-cf-applications-dotnetcore) section for more information.

Tracing PHP applications running with the PHP buildpack is not supported.
The Instana agent does not automatically trace them.

Tracing Python applications running with the Python buildpack requires following the "Activating without code changes" method described in the [Python sensor documentation](https://github.com/instana/python-sensor#activating-without-code-changes).
The supported activation method requires setting an environment variable, which can be specified in the `cf push` manifest as shown in the [Deploying with App Manifests](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html) documentation of Cloud Foundry.

Windows-based Diego Cells are not supported. The Instana agent will not be installed on the Windows-based Diego cells.
