* When using static agents, display their version in the Agents view in Instana.

##<a id="v1.177.0"></a> v1.177.0

**Release Date:** May 17, 2020

New features:

* Support for TAS 2.9
* Integrate the experimental `instana_buildpack`, that automates the setup for Instana monitoring of Node.js, Python and Ruby applications.
  Refer to the [Using the `instana_buildpack`](./using.html#instana-cloudfoundry-buildpack) documentation for more information on how to use the `instana_buildpack` buildpack.
* All Kubernetes resources created by the tile on VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid are labelled with `app.kubernetes.io/name` and `app.kubernetes.io/version`.

##<a id="v1.176.0"></a> v1.176.0

**Release Date:** April 27, 2020

New features:

* Rebranding of PKS to VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid
* VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid clusters (formerly: Pivotal Container Service) are now recognized and marked as such in the Instana UI.
* Introduced notion of `foundation`, which is applicable to both VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid and TAS and allows you to group and filter in Instana by the Tanzu foundation name.
* Tracing Ruby applications in Cloud Foundry is now generally available.
* Tracing PHP applications in Cloud Foundry is now experimental: the tracing itself works great and is entirely automated; we need to correlate to the infrastructure (Cloud Foundry app and below) correctly.
* The origin of the Instana agents in the `Agents` view in Instana is now `tile`. The Instana agents installed on VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid worker nodes will be reported as `public docker` for consistency with other Kubernetes deployment means.
* Greatly improved the efficiency deployment mechanism of Instana agent Docker images on Kubernetes Grid worker nodes.

Bug fix:

* Fix race condition between BOSH updates and agent updates in dynamic mode.

##<a id="v1.173.1"></a> v1.173.1

**Release Date:** March 30, 2020

Bug fix:

* Prevent race condition that would cause Garden containers to be recognized as ContainerD containers instead, thus preventing the processes inside those containers from being traced. (Instana has generally support for ContainerD as well, but it is not applicable to Garden containers.)

##<a id="v1.173.0"></a> v1.173.0

**Release Date:** March 24, 2020

New features:

* Added support for self-contained .NET Core applications.
* Address rebranding of Pivotal Platform to VMware Tanzu

##<a id="v1.172.1"></a> v1.172.1

**Release Date:** February 27, 2020

New features:

* Added support for Pivotal Isolation Segment in conjunction with the Tile Replicator

##<a id="v1.172.0"></a> v1.172.0

**Release Date:** February 25, 2020

New features:

* Added support for Pivotal Isolation Segment
* Collect the instance identifier for Cloud Foundry application instances

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed an issue with the instana-agent BOSH release that prevented settings for `router` and `diego_cell` instance groups to apply to their isolated counterparts

##<a id="v1.170.0"></a> v1.170.0

**Release Date:** January 30, 2020

First release of 2020, and the year starts *strong*!

New features:

* TAS for VMs: v2.8 support
* PKS: Support for the agents to report to multiple backends
* PKS: General Availability!
* Automatic monitoring of MongoDB service instances spawned from the MongoDB Enterprise Service for VMware Tanzu

Improvements:

* The Instana tile no longer declares itself as a `service_broker` tile, so no network and availability zone allocation is required.
While it has been working transparently via the OpsManager web interface, the required allocation to networks caused issues with `om configure-product` command; these issues are now resolved.

Bug fix:

* Resolved an issue that might prevent the Instana agent Docker images from updating on PKS over the Tile update.

##<a id="v1.168.0"></a> v1.168.0

**Release Date:** December 19, 2019

* All tile settings are compatible with the `om` utility.
* [Experimental] Automatically monitor all RabbitMQ queues of service instances spawned via the RabbitMQ for VMware Tanzu tile.

Bug fix:
