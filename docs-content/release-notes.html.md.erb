These are release notes for Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for VMware Tanzu.

##<a id="v1.175.0"></a> v1.175.0

**Release Date:** April 14, 2020

New features:

* Expose the VMware Tanzu foundation name in the Cloud Foundry dashboards.
* PKS clusters are not marked as `Managed by Pivotal Container Service` in the Kubernetes dashboards.
* Tracing Ruby applications in Cloud Foundry is now generally available.
* Tracing PHP applications in Cloud Foundry is now experimental; the tracing itself works very well and is entirely automated; we need to perform a few changes to correlate the infrastructure correctly.
* The origin of the Instana agents in the `Agents` view in Instana is now `tile`; the Instana agents installed on PKS worker nodes will be reported as `public docker` for consistency with other Kubernetes deployment means.

##<a id="v1.173.1"></a> v1.173.1

**Release Date:** March 30, 2020

Bug fix:

* Prevent race condition that would cause Garden containers to be recognized as ContainerD containers instead, thus preventing the processes inside those containers from being traced. (Instana has generally support for ContainerD as well, but it is not applicable to Garden containers.)

##<a id="v1.173.0"></a> v1.173.0

**Release Date:** March 24, 2020

New features:

* Added support for self-contained .NET Core applications.
* Address rebranding of Pivotal Platform to VMware Tanzu

##<a id="v1.172.1"></a> v1.172.1

**Release Date:** February 27, 2020

New features:

* Added support for Pivotal Isolation Segment in conjunction with the Tile Replicator

##<a id="v1.172.0"></a> v1.172.0

**Release Date:** February 25, 2020

New features:

* Added support for Pivotal Isolation Segment
* Collect the instance identifier for Cloud Foundry application instances

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed an issue with the instana-agent BOSH release that prevented settings for `router` and `diego_cell` instance groups to apply to their isolated counterparts

##<a id="v1.170.0"></a> v1.170.0

**Release Date:** January 30, 2020

First release of 2020, and the year starts *strong*!

New features:

* TAS for VMs: v2.8 support
* PKS: Support for the agents to report to multiple backends
* PKS: General Availability!
* Automatic monitoring of MongoDB service instances spawned from the MongoDB Enterprise Service for VMware Tanzu

Improvements:

* The Instana tile no longer declares itself as a `service_broker` tile, so no network and availability zone allocation is required.
While it has been working transparently via the OpsManager web interface, the required allocation to networks caused issues with `om configure-product` command; these issues are now resolved.

Bug fix:

* Resolved an issue that might prevent the Instana agent Docker images from updating on PKS over the Tile update.

##<a id="v1.168.0"></a> v1.168.0

**Release Date:** December 19, 2019

Last update for this year, but tons of new stuff!

New features:

* Pod Security Policies support for PKS.
* Out-of-the-box process monitoring in terms of CPU, memory and open files for GoRouter, Cloud Controller, Kube-related processes on the master nodes of PKS, BOSH agent and BOSH DNS-related processes.
* Automatic management of maintenance windows based on BOSH tasks; for more information, see the [Automatic Maintenance Windows for BOSH deployments](./using.html#maintenance-windows) section.
* All tile settings are compatible with the `om` utility.
* [Experimental] Automatically monitor all RabbitMQ queues of service instances spawned via the RabbitMQ for VMware Tanzu tile.

Bug fix:

* Air-gap the PKS support by embedding the `leader-elector` image in the tile.
